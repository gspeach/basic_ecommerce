# basic_ecommerce
This project is a basic e-commerce site created with PHP and SQL. This was created as a basic template for my own personal use, as well as practice. This does not have the complete functionality of an e-commerce site, but is a basic representation of one. All of the code in this is my own, with the help of online references such as PHP Manual and W3Schools.
